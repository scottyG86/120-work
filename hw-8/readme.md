# Summary
  I created a color changing array of randomly placed particles

  ## Details

  I spent a lot of time thinking about how to make the color change in a uniform way.
  I decided to make it generate in layers so that the entire screen would fill up with dots.
  I used a while loop to make sure that the layers didn't generate outside of the screen.
  I used two for loops, one to determine how many layers of a single color would be drawn and the other to determine how many particles would be drawn on each layer.
