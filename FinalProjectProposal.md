# Final Project Proposal for Scotty Graham

So my Grand Idea is to do an audio visualizer that utilizes p5.sound to create a truly stunning "video" for a song that I wrote.

##  Inspiration and Influence

My idea came from a couple different sources. The biggest one being that trying to do this in something like adobe after effects takes way too long and usually ends in frustration because of poor rendering or something like that. The other being youtube channels like House Nation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo9oi0Y0g9Q and Trap Nation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_-a9nVZYjk.

## Everything I will need to learn

Hopefully I will be an expert in using p5.sound by the end of my project because i will be trying to utilize most if not all of its potential for graphic art in this project.

## Deadlines

I will be working on this as my primary project for the next week using all of my available free time to finish this thing. I will also use time that I would be writing music to work on this (as this heavily relates to music).

## Any work I've done already

I have not started to actually put together the pieces but I have started to research how to use p5.Sound and will be working on this whenever and wherever I have time.
