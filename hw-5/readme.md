# Homework for week 5

## What I did

 - I created an abstract fractal-esk sketch.

## My process

 - I originally wanted to make a spirograph but as I was messing around with my sketch I created a very cool abstract sketch that somewhat mimics a fractal process.

 I did have some issues with getting certain values to update in the draw loop but I googled my problem and found multiple examples to work off of.
