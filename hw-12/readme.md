# Summary
I created a somewhat generative sketch using collisions to determine when elements would be created or destroyed. It is a very colorful and organic feeling sketch.

## Details
 - Originally I was going make something that would sync to music(yet again my struggles with the p5.sound defeated me.) But instead I went with a bit more of a dynamic piece.
 - I kind of accidentally came upon the way the ellipses stay for a while.

 ### Struggles
  Aside from the p5.sound not working, I had no major stuggles with any of the content from this week or last(it was all the same ballpark), which I was happy with.
