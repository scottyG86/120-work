# Homework for week 4

## Summary
- I made a demon spider in p5 using mostly ellipses and lines.

## Details
- I went through multiple ideas, I decided to do the spider because I thought it would be a unique and interesting monster.
- I was experiencing multiple issues with the time it took to see my changes on my browser, so I used the console's editor and then copied it into my project after I made the changes I needed.
- I had an issue where the console was throwing a false error on a specific line regardless of what text was there, so I reloaded the page and re-copied my project into the console.
- I relayed my newfound trick to the rest of the class, hopefully I helped some people with the same problem.
