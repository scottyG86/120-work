# Summary
  I made a glitchy feeling square generator using two functions and an array

## Details
  Origninally I was met with some trouble making the squares fill the screen. Eventually I got it though. It kinda felt like I would patch one hole and then three more would pop up but I guess thats coding for ya. getting the squares to "glitch" was just a combination of randomly offsetting the positions and creationg gaps between layers. I thought that this week has been the most challenging by far, but I also had the most fun with it and felt the most rewarded afterwards.
