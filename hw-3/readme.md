# Homework for Week 3



- I used Atom to follow along with the coding snippets in the course material.

- I wrote my code neatly and made sure to comment on every line of code to explain what it did.

- I experimented around with different positions and colors as well as different canvas sizes.


## Obstacles I overcame

The only problem I had (though it was a simple fix) was forgetting to use `;` at the end of each line of code. (a rookie mistake)
